                Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right
                mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which
                case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot
                here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring
                are are absolutely amazing.
              </p>
              <p class="places__paragraph_2">
                The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If
                you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
                difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and
                prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts
                of the right one.
